\description{
Simulate a bi-factor or two-tier population structure with cross-loading, pure items and correlated factors.
}
\details{
\code{sim_twoTier} generates bi-factor and two-tier patterns with cross-loadings, pure items and
correlations among the general and group factors. When \code{crossloading} is different than 0, one cross-loading
is introduced for an item pertaining to each group factor. When \code{pure} is TRUE, one item loading of each group
factor is removed so that the item loads entirely on the general factor. To maintain the item communalities
constant upon these modifications, the item loading on the other factors may shrunk (if adding cross-loadings)
or increase (if setting pure items).

Loading magnitudes may range between 0.3-0.5 ("low"), 0.4-0.6 ("medium") and 0.5-0.7 ("high").
