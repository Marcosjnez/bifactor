\title{Get a target from a loading matrix.}
\usage{
get_target(loadings, Phi = NULL, cutoff = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{loadings}{A matrix of loadings.}

\item{Phi}{A correlation matrix among the factors. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{cutoff}{The cut-off used to create the target matrix. Defaults to 0.}
}
\value{
A target matrix.
}
\description{
Get a target for the loading matrix using a custom or empirical cut-off.
}
\details{
If \code{cutoff} is not 0, loadings smaller than such a cut-off are fixed to 0. When \code{cutoff = 0}, an empirical cut-off is used for each column of the loading matrix. They are the mean of the one-lagged differences of the sorted squared normalized loadings. Then, the target is determined by fixing to 0 the squared normalized loadings smaller than such cut-offs.
