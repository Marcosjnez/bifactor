\title{Fast polychoric correlations.}
\usage{
polyfast(X, acov = "none", smooth = "pd", min_eigval = 0.001, nboot = 1000L, fit = FALSE, cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix of categorical scores. The lowest score must start at 0.}

\item{acov}{Use acov = 'cov' to obtain the asymptotic covariance matrix and acov = 'var' to simply obtain the asymptotic variances. Use "bootstrap" for estimating the asymptotic covariance matrix by resampling. Defaults to "none".}

\item{smooth}{Smooth the matrix to be positive definite ("pd"), positive semi-definite ("psd"), or estimate the maximum likely polychoric correlation matrix under the positive semi-definite constraint ("analytical"). Defaults to "none".}

\item{min_eigval}{Minimum eigenvalue when smooth = "pd". Defaults to 0.001.}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap samples to compute the standard errors. It only works if acov = "bootstrap". Defaults to 1000L.}

\item{fit}{Should the fit value be calculated? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cores}{Number of parallel cores to compute the polychoric correlations.}
}
\value{
