\title{Fast polychoric correlations.}
\usage{
polyfast(X, acov = "none", PD = FALSE, cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix of categorical scores. The lowest score must start at 0.}

\item{acov}{Use acov = 'cov' to obtain the asymptotic covariance matrix and acov = 'var' to simply obtain the asymptotic variances. Defaults to "none".}

\item{PD}{Force a positive definite solution? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{cores}{Number of parallel cores to compute the polychoric correlations.}
}
\value{
A list with the polychoric correlations, the thresholds, and the elapsed time in nanoseconds.
}
\description{
Compute huge polychoric correlation matrices very fast.
}
