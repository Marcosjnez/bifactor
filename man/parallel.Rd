\title{Hierarchical parallel analysis using either principal components (PCA) or principal axis factoring (PAF).}
\usage{
parallel(X, nboot = 100L, type = "pearson", quant = NULL, mean = TRUE, replace = FALSE,
PA = NULL, hierarchical = FALSE, efa = NULL, cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Raw data matrix.}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap samples.}

\item{type}{Type of correlations: "pearson" or "poly".}

\item{quant}{Vector of quantiles of the distribution of bootstrap eigenvalues to which the compare the sample eigenvalues.}

\item{mean}{Logical. Compare the sample eigenvalues to the mean of the bootstrap eigenvalues. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{replace}{Logical indicating whether the columns of \code{X} should be permuted with replacement.}

\item{PA}{Parallel analysis method. It can be either principal components ("PCA"), principal axis ("PAF") or both ("PCA" and "PAF"). Defaults to NULL, which sets c("PCA", "PAF").}

\item{hierarchical}{Logical indicating whether a second parallel analysis should be performed from the factor scores obtained after a first factor analysis analysis.}

\item{efa}{A list of arguments to pass to \code{efast} when \code{hierarchical = TRUE}.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to perform the parallel bootstrapping.}
}
\value{
A list with the bootstrapped eigenvalues and the estimated dimensionality.
}
